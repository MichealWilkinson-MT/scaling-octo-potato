/**
    Below is an example of a function which takes 2 arguments

    function exampleFunc (arg1, arg2) {
        // function code would go here
    }

    To call this you would add a line

    exampleFunc("ValueForArg1", "ValueForArg2")

    Exercise:
    Create a function which takes a single argument and will print it to the terminal with console.log()
